\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}


Due to the advent of multicore processors, concurrent programming has become an important part in software engineering.
Dealing with parallelism isn't easy however.
There are many pitfalls, such as race conditions and deadlocks.

In practice programmers have learned to avoid tricky concurrency problems with the use of some well-known patterns.
These patterns are often shipped as part of the standard library of the language, such that users rarely have to implement them.

The Eiffel programming language \cite{web:ecma-eiffel}\cite{book:touchofclass} has an extension called SCOOP \cite{Nienaltowski07}\cite{web:scoop},
which stands for Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming.
SCOOP simplifies concurrent programming a lot and eliminates one source of errors completely, namely race conditions \cite{Nienaltowski07}.
However, there is little experience on how to implement popular concurrency patterns, like a worker pool, in SCOOP.

This thesis tries to fill this gap by providing a library of reusable concurrency patterns as well as methodical advice on programming in SCOOP.
The main contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item A broad survey of known concurrency patterns.
 \item The identification of common SCOOP challenges and advice on how to solve them.
 \item A new library which provides implementations for some selected concurrency patterns.
 This selection was mainly based on input from the Software Engineering group at ETH ZÃ¼rich and the study of Java \cite{web:java-concurrency} and C\# \cite{web:ms-tpl} concurrency libraries.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overview}

Section \ref{sec:pattern_overview} introduces a list of concurrency patterns which we found and categorized by studying literature and the standard libraries.
A brief introduction of the SCOOP model is given in Section \ref{sec:scoop-model}.
Section \ref{sec:scoop-challenges} describes some challenges when programming in SCOOP and how to solve them.
The latter two sections may be interesting for programmers having experience in threaded programming and who wish to learn SCOOP.

The focus of Section \ref{sec:library} is on the goals and concepts of the concurrency patterns library.
It also provides an overview over the available modules and describes which patterns are implemented by which modules.

A detailed explanation over the individual modules is given by Section \ref{sec:modules}.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:evaluation} provides a small performance evaluation of the library.

\section{Evaluation}
\label {sec:evaluation}

To evaluate the library we did a small performance benchmark.
We implemented the Gaussian elimination algorithm in three different ways: sequentially, with SCOOP only, and using the future module (see Section \ref{sec:futures}) from our library.
We chose to use the future module because it indirectly also measures many other parts of the library like the worker pool or import mechanism.

We ran the tests with randomly generated square matrices.
The order of a matrix was always a power of two in the range from 32 to 1024.
Additionally, there was one more column for the result vector in the system of linear equations.
Each test was repeated 5 times.
The test system was a quad-core AMD Phenom II X4 955 processor with 6 GB of RAM.
The results are shown Table \ref{table:perf-results}.

\begin{table} [h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l l l|} 
\hline
Matrix Size & Future & Raw SCOOP & Sequential\\
\hline
32 & 0.36 & 0.19 &  \textless 0.01\\
64 & 1.67 & 1.11 & \textless 0.01\\
128 & 8.45 & 9.27 & 0.04\\
256 & 26.45 & 66.56 & 0.33\\
512 & 102.28 & 515.11 & 2.62\\
1000 & - &  3937.2 & - \\
1024 & 424.32 & error & 20.79 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Average time in seconds for different algorithms.}
\label{table:perf-results}
\end{table}

We can get several observations from the results:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The raw SCOOP solution fails for the biggest matrix.
 This is a known bug \cite{web:scoop-issues}:
 The algorithm uses more than the maximum number of processors.
 The library solution doesn't suffer from this problem because it's using a fixed amount of processors.
 \item Futures are faster than raw SCOOP for large data sets.
 \item For smaller data sets, raw SCOOP beats the library.
 \item Sequential execution is much faster than SCOOP.
\end{itemize}

The last observation is probably the most fundamental.
The SCOOP runtime really needs to be improved in order to make it competitive to threaded systems, or even sequential ones.
Fortunately an improved version \cite{thesis:scottwest} is being developed at the time of writing.
It will probably be integrated into a future EiffelStudio release.

Another improvement which might be useful for the library is the Passive Processor concept \cite{paper:passive-processors}.
If both the worker pool and the promise processor could be declared passive the computation speed up a lot.

\section{Conclusion}
% Explain what is the impact of the selected patterns, and why they were selected.
% Say that import was developed to overcome language limitation
% Also: Future work

Concurrent programming is increasingly becoming the norm despite its difficulties.
The SCOOP model provides a solid foundation to concurrent programming in Eiffel, 
but it is hard to learn for developers due to the paradigm shift and the lack of a concurrency library.

In this thesis we've worked out many methods that simplify concurrent programming in SCOOP.
We did a broad survey of popular concurrency patterns and present our findings in a detailed list.
The list can be used to search for a pattern that fits a particular problem, which may even be useful to programmers of threaded languages.

From our survey we selected some patterns which we thought to be especially useful.
The selection was based on the study of other concurrency libraries as well as some input from the Software Engineering research group at ETH.
The seleted patterns were then implemented and are now available as a new Eiffel library.
Besides the pattern implementations, the library also provides some workarounds for current SCOOP limitations, such as the missing import statement.

Performance measurements for the Future pattern showed that the library is actually faster for large data sets and uses less threads than the native SCOOP approach.

Finally, we also described some challenges when programming in SCOOP and how to solve them.
This is especially useful to developers experienced in threaded programming who want to use SCOOP for the first time.

\subsection{Future work}

The library provides several opportunities for future work.

\begin{description}
 \item [More patterns] The library can be extended with additional patterns.
 It may be useful to include Pipeline or Dataflow Network.
 \item [Separate Proxies] The Separate Proxy pattern may be applied to some EiffelBase classes, such as \lstinline!ARRAYED_LIST!, \lstinline!HASH_TABLE! or \lstinline!ROUTINE!.
 \item [Separate Proxy Wizard] Writing a Separate Proxy is tedious. Most of it could be automated with a wizard however.
 \item [Concurrent Datastructures] Sometimes it may be useful to have truly concurrent data structures for performance reasons.
The Array Slicing technique \cite{paper:array-slicing} is an example how arrays with concurrent read access can be implemented in SCOOP.
\end{description}

SCOOP itself also provides a rich offering of possible improvements.

\begin{description}
 \item [Faster runtime] The SCOOP runtime needs to become faster. 
 This is currently being developed \cite{thesis:scottwest}.
 \item [Native Import] A native SCOOP import mechanism is a great tool to deal with a lot of small objects.
 It will also make the library API and implementation simpler, as the manual import workaround can be removed.
 \item [Passive Processors] The passive processors concept \cite{paper:passive-processors} could be integrated into EiffelStudio.
 It can make a big performance improvement to situations where one needs to pass data from one processor to another.
 \item [Separate references] The handling of separate references should become more convenient.
 At the moment programmers are forced to write a lot of small, annoying features to perform separate calls.
 Some syntactic sugar would be really helpful.
