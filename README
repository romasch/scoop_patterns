This project contains a library for concurrency patterns for Eiffel
with the SCOOP extension. It was developed as part of my master thesis.

This repository is now a static snapshot. Further changes should go to:
https://svn.eiffel.com/eiffelstudio/branches/eth/eve/Src/unstable/library/scoop_patterns/

These commits are important for some milestones:
463becd -> Commit for code review.
27efc84 -> Commit when thesis was turned in.
2dc1202 -> Final code change before repository was moved.
